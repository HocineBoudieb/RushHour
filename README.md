# Rush Hour Game

Welcome to the Rush Hour game! This is a C implementation of the classic Rush Hour puzzle game, developed as a project during my first year of engineering. The game features multiple levels, a level editor, the ability to save and load games, take screenshots, view the scoreboard, and more.

## How to Play

1. **Compilation**: Compile the code using a C compiler. For instance, you can use GCC:
gcc main.c -o rush_hour

2. **Execution**: Run the compiled executable:
./rush_hour

3. **Navigation**: Use the arrow keys to move vehicles horizontally or vertically within the grid.

4. **Commands**: Press `h` to access the help menu for a list of available commands.

5. **Saving and Loading**: You can save your game progress and load a previously saved game.

6. **Level Editor**: Create your custom levels using the level editor feature.

7. **Screenshot**: Take screenshots of the game in PPM format.

8. **Scoreboard**: Check out the scoreboard to see how your performance compares to others.

## Controls
